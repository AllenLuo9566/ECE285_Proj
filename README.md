# ECE285_Project

Description
===========

In this project, we use CNN models to classify 101 kinds of food. What we willdo this using two models (VGG-16 and GoogLeNet) which are already capableof extracting features from an image and train its fully connected network inorder to classify different types of food. Also we try to analyze and improve itsperformance by adjusting parameters. Finally we will reach to some overall graphsbased analysis and evaluation for this model. This work will use PyTorch as deeplearning framework and CUDA for GPU acceleration.

Getting Started
===============
Load this dataset with pytorch using ImageFolder as the labels are specified by the folders names.
